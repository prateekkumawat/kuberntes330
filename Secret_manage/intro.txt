# Secret in kubernetes use to maintain senstive data. 
#
# 1. docker registry   2. tls      3. generic 
# Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.
#  Secrets can be created independently of the Pods that use them, there is less risk of the Secret 
#(and its data) being exposed during the workflow of creating, viewing, and editing Pods.
